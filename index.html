      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am web and game designer-in-training. I love video games and visual design almost equally, and hope to use this boot camp
        to further myself in both areas, hopefully landing a career in game design. 
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Sacramento, recently moved in with my fiance Gabi. I love Sacramento, particularly Oak Park where I am living.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love video games, music, and food. I hope to design games similar to Rimworld and Kerbal Space Program, and am an avid baker.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Astronaut Explorer, post intergalactic flight being normalized. Inventor/video game designer as a second place.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently living in Sacramento, in Oak Park.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I like that web development, and programming in general, allows you to create the things you imagine. There is almost no limit
        to what you can accomplish using computers, and that is a really exciting idea to me.
